The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization. Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Here the term authentication is used to refer to both tasks.
For more robust authentication, Django REST Framework provides integration with OAuth 2.0. OAuth is an authorization standard that allows users to grant third-party access to their data. Typically, this allows users to log in via an external OAuth provider like Google or Facebook.
